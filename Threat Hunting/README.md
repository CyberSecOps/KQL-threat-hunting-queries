# Queries MITRE ATT&CK Mapping

I try to map threat hunting & detecting queries on MITRE ATT&CK framework and hence, as soon as a query is added it will be also be indexed below per Tactic and a heat map over covered techniques and sub-techniques will be also be maintained.

#### Navigation

- Queries mapped on MITRE ATT&CK
- Queries not mapped on MITRE ATT&CK
